#  ARRANGE AND OPTIMIZE THESE CODE FOR FUNCTIONIZING
# analysis and gathering information of 10 most sold items (Month10.txt)

#Firstly, this algorithm is able to import needed data from .txt files according to product 
#type. Then, this bunch of data enables to us that plotting graphs according some paramters,
#drawing line mapped data with respect data distribution and visualize data distrubition 
#over USA geophysical map in different color tone ranges. There is additional information
#about some other paraeters which exist in data like zipcode, selling, profit...
#Some libraries are imported from an outsource code is called H2O package. Explaination are given
# in more detail as command line as below.

### IMPORT DATA AND GET BASIC INFORMATION ###
Raw <- read.table("Month10.txt",sep=",")
Raw <- Format.SaleData(Raw)
products <- data.frame(Name=levels(factor(Raw[,5]))) # see and store how many different products
products$Quantity <- NA

# be careful, both data must be white-space trimmed, even the lists must be. following line of code
# is like a for loop, calculates how much an item sold
products[,2] <- sapply(products[,1],function(x) sum(Raw[which(Raw[,5] == x),7])) # rowwise

# backup the content
backupproducts <- products
# write.csv(products,"ProductInfoMonth10.csv",row.names = FALSE) # set header true when reading
# products <- read.csv("ProductInfoMonth10.csv",header = TRUE) # just an example

### PLOT GRAPHS ###
# take the first 100 of the most sold
MS <- Sort(products,2,decreasing = TRUE)[1:104,] # intentionally taken 4 more rows for the reason at following line
MS <- MS[-c(10,27,71,83),] # remove unwanted products or services (this should be changed according to file)
Raw$Total <- Raw$UnitsShipped*Raw$AverageUnitPrice # get the profit from that product
MS$Profit <- NA    # Initialize two columns 
MS$Price <- NA     # to later fill in

for(i in 1:nrow(MS)){
  index <- which(Raw[,5] == MS[i,1])
  MS[i,c(3,4)]<- c(sum(Raw[index,9]),Raw[index[1],8]) # find profit and price
}
